### Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice, open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`)
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory there, create it
3. In the `custom_components` directory create a new folder called `nanit_sound_light`
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/nanit_sound_light/` directory in this repository

## Configuration

The integration will guide you through the setup process:

1. **Account Credentials** - Enter your Nanit email and password
2. **MFA (if enabled)** - Enter the verification code sent to your email
3. **Device Discovery** - Your Sound + Light devices will be automatically discovered

If your session expires, the integration will automatically handle re-authentication, including MFA if required.

## Supported Entities

| Entity Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Light** | Brightness (0-100%) and color control (HSB) |
| **Switch** | Device power on/off |
| **Number** | Volume control (0-100%) |
| **Select** | Sound selection (No sound + 11 built-in sounds) |
| **Sensor** | Temperature and humidity monitoring |

## Why Sound + Light Only?

This integration is specifically designed for Nanit Sound + Light devices to provide:

- **Reliable Communication** - Direct protobuf protocol with Nanit's speaker WebSocket service
- **Complete Control** - All device functions fully implemented and tested
- **Real-time Updates** - Instant state changes without polling delays
- **Clean Architecture** - Focused scope without camera complexity

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Logging

If you encounter issues, enable debug logging by adding this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.nanit_sound_light: debug
```

Then restart Home Assistant and check **Settings** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Logs**.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Authentication failed | Verify credentials; delete and re-add integration if needed |
| Invalid MFA code | Use the 4-digit code from email (not SMS) |
| No devices found | Ensure device is paired and online in the Nanit app |
| Connection timeout | Check network connectivity and device status |
